      <article>
        <h2>Realty One Group All Stars – Aberdeen, WA</h2>
        <h3 class="job_title">Designated Broker, 2018 – Present</h3>

        <h2>Aloha Coast Realty – Hilo, HI</h2>
        <h3 class="job_title">Founder/Owner/Principal Broker, 2007 – 2019</h3>
        <p>We started the company in 2007 only to have the mortgage and housing markets crash a year later.  We used that downturn to acquire another brokerage and its locations and agents.  In 2010, we acquired one of the larger vacation rental management companies on the Big Island and added that to the product mix. The Pacific Business News honored us as one of the "Fastest 50" in Hawaii - an honor reserved for the 50 fastest growing companies in the State -- in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015.</p>
      </article>
        <p>Between Hilo Medical Center and Aloha Coast Realty, I worked as a real estate agent for RE/MAX Big Island, gaining the experience necessary to take and pass the broker's license (required in Hawai'i to start a  brokerage).</p>

        <h2>Hilo Medical Center – Hilo, HI</h2>
        <h3 class="job_title">Information Systems Manager, 2001 - 2004</h3>
        <p>I managed the Information Systems department in the East Hawaii Region of Hawaii Health Systems Corporation.  Hawaii Health Systems Corporations is a public corporation created by the State of Hawaii to manage and develop the State's public health, critical access hospitals, and associated long-term care facilities.  As a public corporation owned and controlled by the State, we had the worst of both worlds.  We had to operate within the State rules, regulations, and union contracts without the benefit of an actual guaranteed State budget.  Every year was a constant struggle to search for private grants, State funds, and health care revenue while still ensuring that the public received the best care possible. As a critical member of the senior management team., I spearheaded the technical and support staff team and delivered 24-hour services aimed at increasing support responsiveness. I coordinated the needs and requirements of hospitals/long-term care departments and stakeholders, including clinical staff, physicians, administrative staff, quality control, and auditors to resolve issues. I partnered with health care system management throughout the State,  representing the East Hawaii Region in state-wide initiatives and improvements programs.</p>
        <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Planned a large-scale deployment of computers and technology to the front-line medical staff, including determining specifications and needs, budgets, and resources. This project successfully improved clinician efficiency significantly (as well as employee satisfaction).</li>
          <li>Worked with staff at all levels to develop procedures, document processes, create documentation and achieve higher JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) quality scores than the system had ever previously achieved.</li>
          <li>Trained and developed clinicians/staff skills by organizing sessions on utilizing existing/current and planned systems efficiently to ensure improved health care quality and execution of medical operations in compliance with HIPAA-compliant security and privacy concerns.</li>
